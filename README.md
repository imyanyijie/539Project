# Introduction
This is a web app for hand drawing recognization. The training data we use for the machine learning model is from [Google QuickDraw Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). The source code repository is on [Github](https://github.com/imyanyijie/539Project)

# Purpose
Our goal of this project is to build a tool will detect someoneâ€™s hand drawing and try to provide the name of the object.
We use the data provided by Google QuickDraw project to train our CNN+RNN model in order to recognize the handdrawn object.

# Take Away
+ We need more balanced data to be able to produce more successful sentimental analysis
+ Use Flask APIs to separate business logic and web service, and facilitate the collaboration among team members.
